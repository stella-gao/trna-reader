# trna-reader
A project to see if recurrent neural networks can learn to write transcribe tRNA

# Python Modules
* numpy
* keras

# BARNACLE stuff
So BARNACLE is going to be the program that turns the tRNA predictions into tertiary structures! It's going to add some more requirements to the project. Unfortunately, the BARNACLE project seems a little dead, but it's all that I can get for now.

BARNACLE requires biopython in order to manage pdb files and it also needs numpy, which is something we already have.
